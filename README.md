# pwa-example

The intention of this project is to learn about Progressive Web Apps and the importance of using Service Workers. 

For learning purpose I followed the steps from https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/#0
and also added some extra work:
 - Configure and use Gulp.js to process files and create a distributable folder (dist) that can be deployed to any server the Dev want.
 - Configure and use Firebase as a hosting service.

- Will update this readme in future
